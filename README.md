# Text Summarization Application

## Overview
This application is a web-based tool for text summarization built using Streamlit and the T5 transformer model. The app enables users to input a block of text and receive a concise summary generated by a pretrained T5 model.

---

## Features
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use text area for input and displays the summarized output.
- **Transformer-based Summarization**: Utilizes the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model to generate summaries.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Delivers a seamless user experience with a modern UI.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Python Libraries
Install the following Python libraries before running the application:
```bash
pip install streamlit transformers
```

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratikkodag/text_summarization.git
   cd text_summarization
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure all required Python libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies if it doesn’t already exist.)*

3. **Run the Application**
   Launch the application using Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit, typically `http://localhost:8501/`.

## Application Flow

1. **Page Configuration**
   - The page is titled "Text Summarization Application" with a notebook emoji.

2. **Input Text**
   - Users can enter text for summarization in the text area provided.

3. **Generate Summary**
   - On clicking the "Generate Summary" button, the app processes the input text and generates a summary using the T5 model.

4. **Display Results**
   - The generated summary is displayed under the "Generated Summary" section.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Displays an error message if no input text is provided.

## Notes
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the first run, as the T5 model and tokenizer will be downloaded.
- You can replace `t5-small` with a larger variant (e.g., `t5-base`, `t5-large`) for better summarization quality, but note that it will require more computational resources.
